SEEEDS is an experimental super-simple operating system-ish program that you can edit with ease, it runs in the command line, to find the manual, type help, then commands or manual (case sensitive).
The manual is also downloaded with the SEEEDS .zip files.
SEEEDS is non-graphical, and in it's beta stage!
