SEEEDS is an experimental super-simple operating system-ish program that you can edit with ease, it runs in the command line, to find the manual, type help, then commands or manual (case sensitive).
The manual is also downloaded with the SEEEDS .zip files.
SEEEDS is non-graphical, and still being worked on!

Coded in Python

For now only works on any computers with Python installed, you can right click and execute this program. 

You can find support and add-ons for SEEEDS on gitlab at https://gitlab.com/RonniePetrik/seeeds-simple-operating-system-help-support-and-addons

Have Fun!
New software is always added to the add-ons gitlab page before it is added to SEEEDS!(https://gitlab.com/RonniePetrik/seeeds-simple-operating-system-help-support-and-addons)\

The manual command currently does not work in SEEEDS, you have to read the actual file that came with the .zip file!
