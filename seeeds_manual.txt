SEEEDS v0.0.0.6.9 Users/Owners Manual  

Intro To SEEEDS: 

 SEEEDS is a very simple, non-graphic operating system, which is highly experimental. When SEEEDS is started up, you will see a prompt; MM>, this means Main Menu. To continue from this type A, B, or C (case sensitive) these are your input modes, and you can change them at any time by just typing gibberish into them, which will bring you back to the main menu. Don't do this just yet, first I must go over what each one does! 

SEEEDS:  

Before you start having basic, 1979 style fun, you must learn how SEEEDS works! SEEEDS is completely written in python, with no added external software. Now this early version (as you can see in the header) is not capable of too much, but it will improve a LOT over time. SEEEDS can execute basic, small, simple commands. In a version very soon, I plan to add games!!! SEEEDS stands for Simple Educational Experimental Editable DOS-based Software, which (as the name says) is experimental! Any suggestions can be sent to touchportcomputers@outlook.com.
